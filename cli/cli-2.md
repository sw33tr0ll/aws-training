# AWS CLI pt. 2
**Prerequisite:** You have the AWS CLI installed and configured. You can find instructions on that [here](./cli-1).

AWS CLI commands are usually formatted like:
```
aws <command> <subcommands>
```

## aws help
Consult the help info often. The **aws help** command by itself will list the command line options and the different commands

```aws help```

Each command will have it's own help menu with a list of subcommands and other options. You can see these by typing:

```aws <command> help```
